To whom it may concern,

This is a letter, and in it I have what I want to say.  But I surely
cannot say it before it has been written, and it is thus that I now
find myself with pen in hand, approaching this paper.

That said, time is no-one's friend, and therefore I must unfortunately
depart before having shared that which I came to say; which, although
undoubtedly of utmost importance, will have to wait for another day.

Best regards,
